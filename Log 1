This projectâ€™s star is an old Nokia phone I bought online. 

I coincidentally forgot the password, and now the Nokia is going to be a test dummy for EEPROM dumping and hopefully some firmware action later on. 

Below is the tear down of the Nokia to get a better look at what internal components are inside, such as speakers, camera modules, and other ICs. 

My next log will be an update
