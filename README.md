This project is a documentation and analysis of mobile phone PCB structure, design, and security. 

Goal: My main goal for these devices is to understand each IC and its placement (not including transistors, resistors,capacitors etc etc.)  

Mission: successfully explain how a mobile device works and flash a new firmware.

Why: I want to become more familiar with PCB design and best PCB design practices. Furthermore, I want to be able to reprogram chips, dump EEPROM, and extract data directly from the chips.
